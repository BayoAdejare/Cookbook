### Intro
The Amazon Echo is designed to be a voice-first experience.  Alexa operates as a cloud-based service and has limited support for interacting with screen devices, such as phones, tablets, and computers.
Developers may return a "card" along with each spoken response, which is a short block of lightly formatted static content displayed on the Alexa mobile app, or alexa.amazon.com page.
