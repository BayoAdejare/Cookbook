## Hello World - Test your skill <a id="title"></a>
<hr />

Here is how to test your skill.


You can test your skill in a number of ways.   You do not need to publish your skill before you can begin testing and using it on any of your devices.

+ Type in your utterance to the Service Simulator, within the Test page of your skill on the [Developer Portal](https://developer.amazon.com/edw/home.html#/skills/list).
+ Launch [EchoSim.IO](https://echosim.io), the browser based testing tool.
+ Your skill can be launched on any Alexa device you own or have registered, such as Echo, Tap, Dot.
+ You can test your Lambda code from the [Lambda Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home). Click **Actions**, **Configure Test Event**, and select or paste in some test request json.
+ You can review the [Cloudwatch Logs](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home#logs:) to see standard output from your Lambda function executions.  Just click on Logs and then click on the log group with the same name as your function.
+ You can write another javascript script that calls your skill code directly.  See [test.js](tests/test.js).
